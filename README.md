Due to a lack of waste optimized collection , a huge portion of recyclable material ends up in various type of pollution . There is a need for a sustainable waste management system to manage waste all around .
Identify a Real-World Problem or Need

 1. Waste generation is rapidly increasing in urban and rural areas. Due to a lack of waste segregation and optimized collection, a huge portion of recyclable materials ends up in landfills, leading to soil, air, and water pollution. There is a need for a sustainable mechanism to manage waste efficiently and encourage responsible disposal.

 2. Problem Definition

The current waste disposal system does not ensure:

Proper segregation of biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste

Timely collection of filled garbage bins

Awareness and public participation in sustainable waste management



---

 3. Define Clear Objectives and Expected Outcomes

Objectives:

To automate waste segregation using technology

To monitor dustbin capacity in real-time

To promote sustainability through awareness and rewards


Expected Outcomes:

Reduced landfill overload

Efficient waste collection and recycling

Increased public responsibility toward the environment



---

 4. Requirement Analysis

Functional Requirements:

Detect and classify waste (biodegradable / non-biodegradable / recyclable)

Store waste-level data digitally

Notify relevant authorities when a bin is full

Provide user rewards for correct disposal


Non-Functional Requirements:

Cost-effective system

User-friendly interface

High accuracy of waste classification

 5. Top-Down Design / Modularization

Module	Function

User Interaction	Scan / input type of waste
Detection Module	Recognizes category of waste
Segregation Unit	Directs waste to correct compartment
Monitoring Module	Real-time weight/level tracking
Notification Module	Alerts when capacity reaches threshold
Report & Rewards System	Shows eco-points and statistics

Implementation (Concept-Based, Tools may vary by course)

Course Type	Suggested Implementation

Programming (C/Python/Java)	Basic software simulation + database
AI & ML	Train model to classify waste images
Computer Vision	Real-time detection using camera
IoT / Automation	Smart bin using weight/ultrasonic sensors
App Development	Android app for tracking + eco-points



---

 6. Testing and Refinement

Testing includes:

Unit testing: Verify each module individually

Integration testing: Check communication between modules

Performance testing: Ensure fast waste monitoring and notifications

User testing: Verify feedback from public and authorities


Refinement is based on test results:

Increase ML model accuracy by adding more training images

Optimize notification timing

Improve user interface for clarity
